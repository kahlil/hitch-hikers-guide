Get off!!! <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

Note:

- lots of noise
- very tempting to follow along
- fear of being left behind
- twitter, hacker news, etc
- prevents focusing in-depth
- industry evolves fast
- deep breath, get off hype train
- if important will stick around
