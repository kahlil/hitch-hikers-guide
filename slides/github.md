## Find Them on Github

Read some issues. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

Note:

- see how core team and contributors communicate in the issues
- how are problems being solved?
- how fast do contributors or core team respond to issues?
- look at the roadmap of the framework
- Great use of this is Ember RFC on Github: everybody can chime in, not only
contributors to the framework
