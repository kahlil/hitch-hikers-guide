Philosophy, Culture & Community <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

Note:

- we think that we are at a point in the development of JavaScript frameworks, where the deciding factors are not technical
- you have too many good choices that will do the job
- the ultimate deciding factors are non technical in our opinion
- where do you see yourself, your team, your company in relationship to the framework and its surrounding ecosystem?
